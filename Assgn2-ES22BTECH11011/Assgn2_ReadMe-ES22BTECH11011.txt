Instructions:

1. inputGenerator.cpp - prints the values of n, k, c, bt and a randomly generated n x n matrix into the input file inp.txt. 
We can change the values of n, k and the range of numbers in the matrix within the code.

2. Assgn2_Chunk_Src_ES22BTECH11011.cpp, Assgn2_Mixed_Src_ES22BTECH11011.cpp - the source files that take input from inp.txt and output the squared matrix with time taken into out_chunks.txt and out_mixed.txt.

Note: check out (comment in.out) lines 56-57 and line 60 to switch between experiments 1 and 2.

input required: n, k, c, bt separated by spaces, then the matrix with the elements separated by spaces.

output: into out_chunks.txt and out_chunks.txt,  the squared matrix and the runtime.
terminal: average times for the bounded and unbounded threads.
