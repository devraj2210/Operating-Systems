Instructions:

1. inputGenerator.cpp - prints the values of n, k and a randomly generated n x n matrix into the input file inp.txt. 
We can change the values of n, k and the range of numbers in the matrix within the code.

2. Assgn1_Src-ES22BTECH11011_chunks/mixed/mixedchunks.cpp - the source files that take input from inp.txt 
and output the squared matrix with time taken into out.txt

input required: n and k separated by a space, then the matrix with the elements separated by spaces

output: into out.txt,  the squared matrix and the runtime

about runtime: I have counted the time period required for the computations undertaken for squaring the matrix using multithreading, 
               not for the entire program
